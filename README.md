<b>Squared tabs</b>
Default 'curved tabs' can be optionally replaced with classic 'squared tabs'.
Tabs on MacOSX look more like Windows tabs with MacOSX colors on purpose.

<b>Curved alternative tabs</b>
All tabs are curved and use colours known from squared tabs.

<b>Tabs 'not' on top</b>
Simulates 'tabs.onTop=false' setting and moves tabs below navigation toolbar. On MacOSX tabs also get a 'reversed appearance'.

<b>Application button / application menu settings</b>

<i>Application button on [Firefox] titlebar [Windows only]</i>
The titlebar button is fixed on titlebars left like on Firefox since version 4.0. It is enabled by default on Windows systems.

<i>Application button on toolbars</i>
On toolbars the button appears like a default toolbar button.

<i>Application button colours</i>
On titlebar and tabs toolbar the application button can be orange, blue (Aurora), black (Nightly), blue (Palemoon), red, green and gray in normal browsing mode and purple in private browsing mode like on previous Firefox versions.

<i>Note</i>
The new appmenu is not an exact copy of the old one, but looks as original as possible. The 'splitmenu' will not be restored and the appmenu popup/submenus also miss some non-replicable menuitems.

<b>Small navigation toolbar buttons</b>
Navigation toolbar buttons get alternative margins and paddings to simulate old 'small icon view'.

<b>Hide 'Navigation Toolbar'</b>
Hiding navigation toolbar might be interesting after content got moved to other toolbars.

<b>'Add-on Bar'</b>
A toolbar at the bottom of the window. All movable buttons and items can be placed on it. Add-on bar can be enabled/disabled using toolbars context menu (right-click on a toolbar) or using 'Ctrl + /' (Windows/Linux) btw. 'Cmd + /' (MacOSX).

<b>'Additional Toolbar'</b>
A toolbar between navigation toolbar and bookmarks toolbar. It can be enabled/disabled using toolbars context menu (right-click on a toolbar).

<b>Icons + text / text only mode</b>
Simulates old icons + text / text modes where text was displayed below toolbar buttons or button icons got hidden.

<b>Bookmarks menu button</b>
A default 'menu button' which opens the 'classic' bookmarks menu. Positioned on bookmarks toolbar the button also displays its label.

<b>Bookmarks and history sidebar buttons</b>
Buttons which toggle bookmarks and history sidebar.

<b>Back-forward, reload and stop buttons</b>
Browsers default buttons got merged with urlbar and cannot be moved to different toolbar positions or to different toolbars. CTR adds duplicates of these buttons to the customization palette.

<b>Combined reload-stop button</b>
Place reload button AFTER stop button and enable the corresponding option on CTRs preference window. Hovering the option on preference window to get extra information.
Toolbar: [something]...[stop-button][reload-button]...[something]

<b>Spaces, flexible spaces and separators</b>
These toolbar items appear in customizing mode and can be moved to toolbars like on previous Firefox versions.

<b>Windows - Linux - MacOSX</b>
This add-on was tested on Windows 7 (AeroBasic, AeroGlass, Classic) & 8(.1) & XP (Classic, Luna-Blue/Silver/Olive, Zune, Royale), Linux Mint KDE, Ubuntu and MacOSX 10.8/10.9. On other Systems or non OS-default themes tab colors may look wrong. Bookmarks, history, stop, reload, back and forward toolbar buttons use default OS icons (Firefox Windows icons on Windows systems, Firefox Mac icons on MacOSX and Firefox Linux icons on Linux systems).

<b>Major problems with (discontinued?) Foxtab and Shareaholic add-ons</b>
It is strongly recommended to remove Foxtab  and Shareaholic before installing Firefox 29 or newer, because both break Firefox ui in Fx29+. Using Foxtab and/or Shareaholic with CTR breaks the ui even more.
If one of these add-ons already has corrupted the ui, the add-ons manager has to be accessed via menubar (right-click on a toolbar -> select menubar, Tools -> add-ons) and CTR, Shareaholic and Foxtab have to be uninstalled.
After Firefox has been restarted, "restore defaults" in customizing mode has to be hit once. CTR can be reinstalled afterwards and will work properly.

<b>Info, known 'issues', 'glitches'</b>
<ul>
<li>Application menus 'cut', 'copy' and 'paste' buttons do not always work like they should.
<li>Switching between AeroGlass and AeroBasic on Windows 7/Vista can change application buttons position, if the menubar is disabled. Maximizing/restoring browsers main window or restarting Firefox resolves the problem. This glitch is caused by Microsoft Windows and titlebars behavior and not by this add-on.
<li>Entering and leaving customizing mode 'disables' right-click menu items for bookmarks inside bookmarks menu button. A restart resolves this issue.
<li>Tab colors on MacOSX fit to current ui instead of using Firefox 28 colors. This is intended and not a bug.
<li>Do not install this add-on on pre-Australis Firefox (4-28). It is not intended to be used with old browser versions.
<li>This add-on was made for browsers <b>default theme</b> and will not work with all full/complete themes properly. However most Personas/LW-Themes work fine.
</ul>

<b>It is recommended to <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Multiple_Firefox_Profiles>switch to a clean new profile</a> to avoid UI issues after upgrading from Firefox 28 (and older) to Firefox 29 (and newer). <a href=https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/profileswitcher/>Profile Switcher</a> can help too. 

Note: Triggering "Restore Defaults" in customizing mode to reset toolbar configuration is enough in most cases and much easier to perform.</b>

<b>AVAST AV software,"Browser Cleanup" and disappearing Firefox add-ons</b>

Current Avast versions offer a bugged version of "Browser Cleanup", which accidentally removes Firefox add-ons without any proper reason!
Although Avast is currently working on fixing this issues, it is highly recommended to remove or disable "Browser Cleanup" until problems are fixed.
